# dotfiles

This repository holds my personal GNU/Linux configuration files. The whole system is centered around Arch Linux and the excellent [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org), whose configuration is descriped in more detail in its own [README file](https://github.com/grubersjoe/dotfiles/tree/master/i3).

After spending some years with KDE 5 and then GNOME 3 I moved to a more minimalistic, yet all the more flexible desktop environment and haven't regretted it once. It takes some time and work to tweak it the way you want it to be, but the result is very rewarding :).
