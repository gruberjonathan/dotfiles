This repository holds my personal GNU/Linux configuration files. My whole system is centered around Arch Linux andthe excellent [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org), whose configuration is descriped in more detail in its own [README file](https://github.com/grubersjoe/dotfiles/tree/master/i3).

After spending some years with KDE 5 and then GNOME 3 I moved to a more minimalistic, yet all the more flexible desktop environment and haven't regretted it once. It takes some work to make it the environment you want it to be, but afterwards it is very rewarding.
