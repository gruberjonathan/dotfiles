This repository holds my personal GNU/Linux configuration files. I used to run KDE 4, then GNOME 3, after that a minimalistic [i3](https://i3wm.org) setup (tiling window manager ftw) and now I've returned to KDE again (v5 this time). Oh, and [I use Arch btw](https://pics.me.me/btw-i-use-arch-basically-p-23678286.png) :D.

A few years ago I put a lot of time and effort in my i3 setup, which is descriped in more detail in its own [README file](https://github.com/grubersjoe/dotfiles/tree/master/i3).
